A [giter8][g8] template for creating Scala compiler plugins. Please fork/file issues if you
have suggestions for improvement!

If you have installed g8 use
    g8 jrudolph/scalac-plugin
to instantiate your plugin.

You can test your plugin by using the sbt `console` command which includes your plugin automatically.

Have fun!
